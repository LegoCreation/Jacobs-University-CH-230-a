If we remove the using namespace std C++ cannot identify to which class
does the cout, cin and other functions belong. We can also define using
std::(func name) eg std::cout because we are now defining that the cout
belongs to class std.

There could be manny classes in C++ so removing Critter:: will lead
to confusing to C++. The possible solution could
be difing the method within the declaration of the header file.
